###Two types of primary Key
* Natural Primary Key  
  - A member of a class is designated as primary key.
  - When, the value of the member changes, it impacts primary key & impacts entire db.

* Synthetic Primary Key
  - Key generated by application & is independent of class members.
  - Anything can change in the class without impacting anything in database.

###Mechanism to create synthetic keys
In all the below cases, persistence provider is Hibernate
* AUTO           Indicates that the persistence provider should pick an appropriate strategy for the particular database.
* IDENTITY       Indicates that the persistence provider must assign primary keys for the entity using a database identity column.
* SEQUENCE       Indicates that the persistence provider must assign primary keys for the entity using a database sequence.
* TABLE          Indicates that the persistence provider must assign primary keys for the entity using an underlying database table to ensure uniqueness.
