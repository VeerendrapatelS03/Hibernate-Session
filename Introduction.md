##Framework
Set of rules enforced on developers so that the software product development is predictable. Products & companies love framework, as this is what makes the product less dependent on developers. Examples are are - Spring. Hibernate etc.

##Library
Collection of utilities. Using the utilities, developers can ease the work. This doesn't tell user how to develop product.For e.g. jquery 

##JPA - Java Persistence API
The Java Persistence API is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, & managing data between Java Objects/Classes and relational database.Defined as a part of EJB 3.0. JPA is considered the standard industry approach for ORM like Hibernate, Spring Data etc.

* JPA is specification .i.e it tells any ORM what interfaces to expose to application developers
* JPA is just a specification & not a product, it cannot perform persistence or anything else by itself.
* JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires implementation. There are open-souce & commercial JPA implementation to choose from like Hibernate.
* JPA needs database to persist data.

##Hibernate
This is a open source Java persistence framework project.  This perform powerful object relational mapping & query databases using SQL or HQL. Based on JPA, it generates SQL which will be acting upon database. Because database only understand SQL that is generated by Hibernate

##ORM - Object Relational Mapping
* When working with Object Oriented Infrastructure, there is a mismatch.
* Idea of ORM is to minimize the mismatch by mapping objects directly to database.

##Annotation
* This is a mechanism by which application program informs framework program that how should framework code treat application program.
